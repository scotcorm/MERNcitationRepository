# MERN Citation Repository

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## About

This project is a way for me to explore/learn the MERN stack by creating a useful app that should help users save citations in a way that encourages use/reuse. 
The internet is full of useful and unique images, but it is often difficult to know whether they can be reproduced legally.  A repository like this one serves as a curated list to gather clearly licensed images that have been used before, and promise to be useful again.
